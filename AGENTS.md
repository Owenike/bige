# Codex Execution Preferences

## Default Execution Style
- Unless the action is high-risk or destructive, execute commands and code changes directly without asking for per-change confirmation.
- Consider high-risk actions as destructive file operations, irreversible data changes, credential/security-impacting changes, or forceful git history rewrites.
- For high-risk actions only, request explicit confirmation before proceeding.

## Communication
- Keep updates short and action-focused.
- Continue execution end-to-end once a task is clear, without pausing for routine confirmations.
